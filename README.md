# Website journey embedding

## About this project
The objective is to find Joe by looking the anonymized web surfing data.
There are many important features affecting the prediction, but the one I want to present here is website journey of the users.
The journey of each user is given in a form of list, so I used doc2vec to embed the feature, and SVM to make a prediction
